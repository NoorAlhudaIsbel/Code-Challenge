Here you can find a suggested solution of the code challenge.
The tasks are solved using python programing language.
The code is provided in (Code Challenge.py) and the notebook (Jupyter file) is found in (Code Challenge.ipynb).


In the notebook (Code Challenge.ipynb) you will find the code with the explanation and the results, you will also find a pdf version of the notebook in (Code Challenge.pdf).

The code is runnable on python 3.6 and it uses libraries to fullfill the requirement:
- numpy
